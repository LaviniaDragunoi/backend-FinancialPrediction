After reading Head First Learn to code ( Eric Freeman), I came with the idea to create something to consolidate my new knowledge. 

The idea started with the ambition to put on test my new Python knowledge, adding some refreshing on Functional Programming and OOP implementation on a Python project, but more than that using as guidance AI tools to guide me into implementing with FP principles main focus.

This project involves developing the backend data management system for a basic financial application, allowing me to apply and solidify my entry-level Python skills. The primary goal is to create a robust and functional backend that manages financial data and prepares it for consumption by a separate mobile/web  application.
